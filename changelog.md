# Natural Progression Changelog

## 1.1.2

### Added

- Chance config for knapping to not succeed (e.g. not result in flint)
- Ground-type blocks (e.g. gravel, dirt, grass) are now harder to break without the right tool

## 1.1.1

### Fixed

- Server Thread occasionally hanging
- Red Sandstone not dropping its Pebbles

### Changed

- Pebbles will no longer replace blocks other than air and water

## 1.1.0

### Added

- Red Sandstone Pebbles
- Cobbled Red Sandstone

### Changed

- **Important**: Plank recipes are **no longer dynamic**. This means that if you want a plank recipe, you'll need to make it by hand (**even though it may be removed automatically**), but this _does_ add compatability with any mod out there, and for custom more difficult recipes! See [this file](https://gist.github.com/oitsjustjose/11a78df64d55cbcb00c3a7b646db729b#file-damage-tool-example-json) for how to format a recipe like this. Yes, this means that you can use this recipe type to make _any_ recipe that requires a tool, and it will damage (or break if no durability left) that tool. This also takes into account the Unbreaking enchantment!

### Fixed
