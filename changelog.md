# Natural Progression Changelog (1.15)

## 1.3.0

### Added

- **Twigs**: These are sticks that generate on the ground. Break or right-click them to get sticks, instead of having to break leaves (as annoying as that is...).
  - Twig frequency has its own config option and can be completely disabled if you don't care for them.
  - Twig textures rotate randomly.
  - Twig textures rely on your current resource pack's stick texture, so they'll always fit in!
- **Advancements**: Instead of relying on annoying tooltips, an advancements system has been made to assist players step-by-step down their new progression line.
  - Additionally, the old early-game advancements have been removed or shifted to line up with progression changed (e.g. Acquire Hardware follows after getting a bone pick, stone and wood tool achievements removed, etc.).

### Removed

- Help Tooltips
- Sounds

## 1.2.2
