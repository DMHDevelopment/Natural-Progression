# Geolosys Realism

A modpack-friendly extension of Geolosys (though it doesn't require Geolosys!) that changes very early game progression by:

* Disabling tree punching
* Modifying wood crafting recipes
* Adding TFC-like progression such as flint and pebble collection

## ToDo

- [ ] Generate Pebbles
- [x] Remove wooden tool recipes
- [ ] Make Stone drop stone pebbles -[craft]-> cobblestone
- [x] Make Diorite/Andesite/Granite drop their respective pebbles
- [x] Make Stone Pebble knapping for flint (pebble in main and offhand)

## Progression Plan

1. Pick up pebbles
2. Break leaves for sticks
3. Knap pebbles into flint
4. Make flint hatchet
5. Break normal wood
6. Make workbench
7. Craft 3x3 of pebbles into cobblestone
8. Craft stone tools and beyond

## Ideas

* Possibly complicate stuff between step 5 and 6, and add a step for creating planks (or make them craft less?)
    
    * With this, maybe add a saw or make the hatchet work as a saw?
