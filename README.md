# Geolosys Realism

A modpack-friendly extension of Geolosys (though it doesn't require Geolosys!) that changes very early game progression by:

- Disabling tree punching
- Modifying wood crafting recipes
- Adding TFC-like progression such as flint and pebble collection

## ToDo

- [ ] Generate Pebbles
- [x] Plank Crafting Recipes w/ Axe
- [x] Remove wooden tool recipes
- [x] Make Stone drop stone pebbles -[craft]-> cobblestone
- [x] Make Diorite/Andesite/Granite drop their respective pebbles
- [x] Make Stone Pebble knapping for flint (pebble in main and offhand)

## Progression Plan

1. Pick up pebbles
2. Break leaves for sticks
3. Knap pebbles into flint
4. Make flint hatchet
5. Break normal wood
6. Make Planks using Hatchet + Log in crafting grid
7. Make workbench
8. Craft 3x3 of pebbles into cobblestone
9. Craft stone tools and beyond
