# Natural Progression

A modpack-friendly extension of Geolosys (though it doesn't require Geolosys!) that changes very early game progression by:

- Disabling tree punching
- Modifying wood crafting recipes
- Adding TFC-like progression such as flint and pebble collection

## Progression

1. Pick up pebbles
2. Break leaves for sticks
3. Knap pebbles into flint
4. Make flint hatchet
5. Break normal wood
6. Make Planks using Hatchet + Log in crafting grid. This will yield **only one plank**.
7. Make workbench
8. Using the 3x3 grid of the workbench, create a basic saw using flint and sticks. This will allow you to slice logs into **four planks**.
9. Craft 3x3 of pebbles into cobblestone
10. Craft stone tools and beyond - stone tools can be crafted with *any* stone variant (diorite, andesite, granite), not *just* cobble.

## Sounds

Although I didn't need to mention it, I wanted to give credit to Kenny for their RPG sounds kit that you can hear if you enable crafting sounds!
