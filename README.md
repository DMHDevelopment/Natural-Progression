A modpack-friendly extension of Geolosys (though it doesn't require Geolosys!) that changes very early game progression by:

- Disabling tree punching
- Modifying wood crafting recipes (mod compatible, may require DataPacks for full compatability)
- Adds Cobbled Diorite, Andesite and Granite (smeltable into their vanilla non-cobbled variants)
- Adds sounds (configurable) when crafting
- Adding TFC-like progression such as flint and pebble collection
- Works wonderfully with Geolosys for a fully immersive, mod compatible, TFC-like experience.

## Progression

1. Pick up pebbles
2. Break leaves for sticks
3. Knap pebbles into flint
4. Make flint hatchet
5. Break normal wood
6. Make Planks using Hatchet + Log in crafting grid. This will yield **only one plank**.
7. Make workbench
8. Using the 3x3 grid of the workbench, create a basic saw using flint and sticks. This will allow you to slice logs into **four planks**.
9. Craft 3x3 of pebbles into their respective stones/cobblestones
10. Craft stone tools and beyond - stone tools can be crafted with _any_ stone variant (diorite, andesite, granite), not _just_ cobble.

## Sounds

Although I didn't need to mention it, I wanted to give credit to Kenny for their RPG sounds kit that you can hear if you enable crafting sounds!
